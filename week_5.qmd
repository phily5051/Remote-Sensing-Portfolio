<h1>5 Introduction to Google Earth Engine</h1>

<h2>5.1 Summary</h2>

<h3>5.1.1 What is Google Earth Engine (GEE)</h3>

[**Google Earth Engine**](https://earthengine.google.com/) is a **planetary-scale geo-spatial analysis platform**. It enables users to keep track of changes and quantify differences on Earth's surface.

```

<h3>5.1.2 Pros & Cons of GEE</h3>

The advantages and disadvantages of GEE are as follows:

-   Pros:

    1)  GEE stores various, rich and ready-to-use datasets within its server.

    2)  Cloud-based processing: quickly analyses big data 

    3)  User-friendly interface: easy and free access

    4)  Enormous potential to collaborate with state-of-the-art technologies (Deep learning and Machine Learning)

-   Cons:

    1)  Easy access could mean the potential possibilities for inappropriate use by some criminals

    2)  Dependence on Google: concerns around data privacy and security

    3)  Learning curve: coding with Javascript can be challenging

    4)  Limited data types: profoundly limited to satellite imagery, which may not provide access to all the data types that people need

<h3>5.1.3 Aggregating Pixels in GEE</h3>

*To allow large computations*, GEE provides users with **various scale** options to choose from. When an image is fed into GEE, many lower resolution versions of the image are pre-computed, and these are known as **Image Pyramids**.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Pyramids.png')
```

GEE Image Pyramids (Source: [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale#image-pyramids)) 

The lowest level of the image pyramid represents native resolution. The ingested image data are aggregated to a higher pyramid levels until it reaches 256 * 256 pixel tiles. At this aggregation process, GEE uses nearest neighbors by default [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale#image-pyramids). By default, the pyramid tiles are created by calculating *mean* values. This is called **resampling**.

```

<h3>5.1.4 Objects in GEE</h3>

There are 9 object classes in GEE. Each class has its own class-specific functions to load and manipulate data.

```

<h3>5.1.5 Applicable Processes in GEE</h3>

- Reducing images: 

    1) By region(s): It reduces all the pixels in the region(s) to a statistic of the pixel data in the region(s). We can take an image and generate statistics for it. The images of code and result below are adjusted from Andy's Material. I used the Global Forest Change datasets to see the average reflectance for each band within Sierra Nevada, USA.

```

knitr::include_graphics('img/reduce_ex.png')
```

    2) By neighbourhoods: The neighbourhoods of a pixel in an image can be used to reduce the image.
