    "text": "3 Application\nRemote sensing is widely used in various fields of domain, such as forestry, urban planning and so on (Aggarwal 2004). In the context of climate change, monitoring forest degradation can be done using remote sensing. According to Lambin (1999), combining different types of resolution - spectral, spatial and temporal - enables a comprehensive forest monitoring. Rosenqvist et al. (2003) acknowledged the role of remote sensing in assisting with achieving the requirements of Kyoto Protocol by quantifying the land cover change and biomass stocks.\n\n\n4 Personal reflection\nAs a person who is interested in urban green spaces, the spectral resolution was an interesting concept. Vegetation shows a huge spike in near infrared radiation. This questions me whether the health of urban parks in a city (bad and good) can result in a difference in reflectance rate. Little and Summy (2012) discovered that different reflectance was detected between healthy and stressed leaves. I reckon this can be a good indicator of monitoring urban green space’s health apart from physical measuring. This will be more cost- and time-efficient.\n\n\n\n\nAggarwal, Shefali. 2004. “Principles of Remote Sensing.” Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS Applications in Agricultural Meteorology 23 (2): 2328.\n\n\nLambin, Eric F. 1999. “Monitoring Forest Degradation in Tropical Regions by Remote Sensing: Some Methodological Issues.” Global Ecology and Biogeography 8 (3-4): 191198.\n\n\nLittle, Christopher R, and Kenneth R Summy. 2012. “Accurate Spectral Measurements and Color Infrared Imagery of Excised Leaves Exhibiting Gaussian Curvature from Healthy and Stressed Plants.” Advanced Image Acquisition, Processing Techniques and Applications I, 123142.\n\n\nRosenqvist, Åke, Anthony Milne, Richard Lucas, Marc Imhoff, and Craig Dobson. 2003. “A Review of Remote Sensing Technology in Support of the Kyoto Protocol.” Environmental Science & Policy 6 (5): 441455."
