    "text": "According to NASA, remote sensing refers to information obtained at a distance. These sensors are placed on satellites or aircrafts and they detect and document reflected or emitted energy.\n\nTO cut it short, the answer is Dlectromagnetic Radiation (EMR). This energy travels in different forms of waves through the atmosphere. While human eyes only detects visible light, the sensors can utilise the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum (Source: NASA Science)\n\nThere are two types of remote sensors: active and passive sensors.\n\nActive sensor:\n\nemits electromagnetic energy and receives the reflected energy\ncan observe areas under most conditions as most active sensors operate in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum\nrequires power source - solar energy\naffected by space weather - solar flares\n\nPassive sensor:\n\nusually detects reflected energy\nused for measuring physical attributes, such as land/sea surface temperature and vegetation cover\nhas limitations in observing areas in the presence of dense cloud cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive and Active Sensors (Source: NASA)\n\nYes, these radiations are often influenced by Earth’s surface and atmospheric conditions, which might distort the original information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMR’s interaction with surface and atmosphere (Source: Daneshgar, 2015)\n\n\nSpatial resolution: sizes of the raster cells\nSpectral resolution:\n- Values for each wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum creates a spectral signature\n- Every object has its own unique spectral signature, thus it can be used for identifying a specific object\n- But spectral resolution is often affected by atmospheric particles which absorb parts of the spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Electromagnetic Opacity (Source: GIS Geography)\n\nTemporal resolution: frequency of the recorded data\nRadiometric resolution: sensor’s ability to detect subtle differences in energy which determines the quality of images\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing is widely used in various fields of domain, such as forestry, urban planning and so on (Aggarwal 2004). In the context of climate change, monitoring forest degradation can be done using remote sensing. According to Lambin (1999), combining different types of resolution - spectral, spatial and temporal - enables a comprehensive forest monitoring. Rosenqvist et al. (2003) acknowledged the role of remote sensing in assisting with achieving the requirements of Kyoto Protocol by quantifying the land cover change and biomass stocks.\n\n\n\nAs a person who is interested in urban green spaces, the spectral resolution was an interesting concept. Vegetation shows a huge spike in near infrared radiation. This questions me whether the health of urban parks in a city (bad and good) can result in a difference in reflectance rate. Little and Summy (2012) discovered that different reflectance was detected between healthy and stressed leaves. I reckon this can be a good indicator of monitoring urban green space’s health apart from physical measuring. This will be more cost- and time-efficient.\n\n\n\n\nAggarwal, Shefali. 2004. “Principles of Remote Sensing.” Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS Applications in Agricultural Meteorology 23 (2): 2328.\n\n\nLambin, Eric F. 1999. “Monitoring Forest Degradation in Tropical Regions by Remote Sensing: Some Methodological Issues.” Global Ecology and Biogeography 8 (3-4): 191198.\n\n\nLittle, Christopher R, and Kenneth R Summy. 2012. “Accurate Spectral Measurements and Color Infrared Imagery of Excised Leaves Exhibiting Gaussian Curvature from Healthy and Stressed Plants.” Advanced Image Acquisition, Processing Techniques and Applications I, 123142.\n\n\nRosenqvist, Åke, Anthony Milne, Richard Lucas, Marc Imhoff, and Craig Dobson. 2003. “A Review of Remote Sensing Technology in Support of the Kyoto Protocol.” Environmental Science & Policy 6 (5): 441455."
