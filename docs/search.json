    "text": "Summary\n\n\nDefinition of Remote Sensing\n\nAccording to NASA, remote sensing refers to information obtained at a distance. These sensors are placed on satellites or aircrafts and they detect and document reflected or emitted energy.\n\nWhat kinds of energy?\n\nTO cut it short, the answer is Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). This energy travels in different forms of waves through the atmosphere. While human eyes only detects visible light, the sensors can utilise the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum (Source: NASA Science)\n\nSensor Types\n\nThere are two types of remote sensors: active and passive sensors.\n\nActive sensor:\n\nemits electromagnetic energy and receives the reflected energy\ncan observe areas under most conditions as most active sensors operate in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum\nrequires power source - solar energy\naffected by space weather - solar flares\n\nPassive sensor:\n\nusually detects reflected energy\nused for measuring physical attributes, such as land/sea surface temperature and vegetation cover\nhas limitations in observing areas in the presence of dense cloud cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive and Active Sensors (Source: NASA)\n\nDoes EMR interact with other factors?\n\nYes, these radiations are often influenced by Earth’s surface and atmospheric conditions, which might distort the original information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMR’s interaction with surface and atmosphere (Source: Daneshgar, 2015)\n\n4 Resolutions of Remote Sensing Data\n\n\nSpatial resolution: sizes of the raster cells\nSpectral resolution:\n\nValues for each wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum creates a spectral signature\nEvery object has its own unique spectral signature, thus it can be used for identifying a specific object\nBut spectral resolution is often affected by atmospheric particles which absorb parts of the spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Electromagnetic Opacity (Source: GIS Geography)\n\nTemporal resolution: frequency of the recorded data\nRadiometric resolution: sensor’s ability to detect subtle differences in energy which determines the quality of images\n\n\nApplication\n\nIn the context of climate change, the ability to map tree types are important as they are closely linked to biodiversity. As mentioned earlier, each feature has different spectral signatures. Durgante et al. (2013) have discovered that spectral signature of tree species was better than DNA identification in distinguishing tree species. The researchers used ‘Fourier-Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR)’. It obtained the best results of 99.4% of correct specimen identification when using 36 spectral readings per specimen. This somehow opens a new, cost- and time-efficient avenue in mapping forest resources. Their research is meaningful in a sense that it enables us to identify types of forests in which forests are not easily accessible by humans or should be intact from human interferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral signatures of each tree (Source: Durgante et al., 2013)\nThe potential of spectral signature can also be found in the business sector. Yang, Lee, and Williamson (2012) suggested that spectral signatures could be employed to blueberry yield estimation system. The research team confirmed six-class blueberry classification - 233, 551, 554, 691, 699, 1373 nm - yielded the best results. This showed the potential of the spectral signature in developing fast and low cost blueberry detector. Furthermore, this research expands the use of spectral signatures from academia to industry, and suggests that the use of spectral signature can be boundless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent absorbance rate depending on blueberry’s growth (Source: Yang and Williamson, 2012)\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nAs a person who is interested in urban green spaces, the spectral resolution was an interesting concept. After understanding how it can be applied in both academia and industry, I wondered whether the health of green spaces in a city can also be measured with it. Furthermore, I was wondering whether there are any methods that improves the quality of data obtained from passive sensors as they cannot obtain a good quality data in the presence of bad weather. Under the circumstances where we have passive sensors, are there any techniques that could correct images?\n\nReferences\n\nNASA EarthData. (n.d.) https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/.
