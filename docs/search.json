    "text": "Summary\n\n\nDefinition of Remote Sensing\n\nAccording to NASA, remote sensing refers to information obtained at a distance. These sensors are placed on satellites or aircrafts and they detect and document reflected or emitted energy.\n\nWhat kinds of energy?\n\nTO cut it short, the answer is Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). This energy travels in different forms of waves through the atmosphere. While human eyes only detects visible light, the sensors can utilise the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to collect data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum (Source: NASA Science)\n\nSensor Types\n\nThere are two types of remote sensors: active and passive sensors.\n\nActive sensor:\n\nemits electromagnetic energy and receives the reflected energy\ncan observe areas under most conditions as most active sensors operate in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum\nrequires power source - solar energy\naffected by space weather - solar flares\n\nPassive sensor:\n\nusually detects reflected energy\nused for measuring physical attributes, such as land/sea surface temperature and vegetation cover\nhas limitations in observing areas in the presence of dense cloud cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive and Active Sensors (Source: NASA)\n\nDoes EMR interact with other factors?\n\nYes, these radiations are often influenced by Earth’s surface and atmospheric conditions, which might distort the original information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMR’s interaction with surface and atmosphere (Source: Daneshgar, 2015)\n\n4 Resolutions of Remote Sensing Data\n\n\nSpatial resolution: sizes of the raster cells\nSpectral resolution:\n\nValues for each wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum creates a spectral signature\nEvery object has its own unique spectral signature, thus it can be used for identifying a specific object\nBut spectral resolution is often affected by atmospheric particles which absorb parts of the spectrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Electromagnetic Opacity (Source: GIS Geography)\n\nTemporal resolution: frequency of the recorded data\nRadiometric resolution: sensor’s ability to detect subtle differences in energy which determines the quality of images\n\n\nApplication\n\nIn the context of climate change, the ability to map tree types are important as they are closely linked to biodiversity. As mentioned earlier, each feature has different spectral signatures. Durgante et al. (2013) have discovered that spectral signature of tree species was better than DNA identification in distinguishing tree species. The researchers used ‘Fourier-Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR)’. It obtained the best results of 99.4% of correct specimen identification when using 36 spectral readings per specimen. This somehow opens a new, cost- and time-efficient avenue in mapping forest resources. Their research is meaningful in a sense that it enables us to identify types of forests in which forests are not easily accessible by humans or should be intact from human interferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectral signatures of each tree (Source: Durgante et al., 2013)\nThe potential of spectral signature can also be found in the business sector. Yang, Lee, and Williamson (2012) suggested that spectral signatures could be employed to blueberry yield estimation system. The research team confirmed six-class blueberry classification - 233, 551, 554, 691, 699, 1373 nm - yielded the best results. This showed the potential of the spectral signature in developing fast and low cost blueberry detector. Furthermore, this research expands the use of spectral signatures from academia to industry, and suggests that the use of spectral signature can be boundless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent absorbance rate depending on blueberry’s growth (Source: Yang and Williamson, 2012)\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nAs a person who is interested in urban green spaces, the spectral resolution was an interesting concept. After understanding how it can be applied in both academia and industry, I wondered whether the health of green spaces in a city can also be measured with it. Furthermore, I was wondering whether there are any methods that improve the quality of data obtained from passive sensors as they cannot obtain a good quality data in the presence of bad weather. Under the circumstances where we have passive sensors, are there any techniques that could correct images?\n\nReferences\n\nNASA EarthData.

    "text": "Summary\n\nIn this diary, I am going to talk about the biggest city plan in South Korea and how a low-level city plan guideline is aligned with its upper-level plan. In particular, I will focus on the implementation of the plan regarding environment and whether there is any implementation that can be benefited from using remote sensing.\n\nBrief Information about 2030 Seoul Plan\n\n2030 Seoul Plan is the highest level city plan in Seoul, South Korea. Provided that Seoul is a capital city in South Korea, its city plan is often considered as significant and determinant as a government-led plan, in terms of its impacts on citizens of Seoul and the country. The plan covers a number of sectors which include housing, transport and environment. The city plan presents Seoul’s future vision and outlines the city’s development plan for the next 10 years.\nWith regards to environment, the plan specifies 3 Targets and 11 Strategies. The 3 targets are as follows:\n\nTarget 1: Ecological city with numerous urban parks\nTarget 2: Energy-efficient city\nTarget 3: Disaster-free city\n\nAmong the illustrated targets, Strategy 1-4 under Target 1 suggests a number of ways to deal with particulate matter, which is one of the biggest environmental issues in South Korea and highly related to citizen’s life. One of the mitigation actions to deal with the air pollutants identified by the Seoul government is creating urban forests on those areas which are specifically vulnerable to fine dust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2030 Seoul Plan (Source: Seoul Metropolitan Government)\n\nUrban Forest Guideline for PM Mitigation\n\nUrban Forest Guideline for PM Mitigation is a low-level city plan which entails types of activities that will be executed in line with the 2030 Seoul Plan. The guideline specified a number of technical rules to follow regarding types of trees to plant, which areas are targeted for urban forests implementation, and suitable distance between each tree stand and so on.\nFurthermore, the guideline categorised six types of urban forests that could mitigate the concentration of PM. These are street trees, urban parks, forests around the city, vegetations in schools and river, and green spaces within proximity to residential areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance between trees in residential areas (Source: Seoul Metropolitan Government)\n\n3 Functional Urban Forest Types for PM Mitigation\n\nThe said urban forest types can be grouped into 3 types of urban forests in terms of their objective and functionality. These are PM blockage urban forests, PM mitigation urban forests and Wind corridor urban forests.\n\nPM blockage urban forests:\n\ndense urban forests with 1,800 trees per ha\nto block PM diffusion\n\nPM mitigation urban forests:\n\nbetween 800 and 1,000 trees per ha\nto enhance PM absorption by urban forests\n\nWind corridor urban forests:\n\n500 trees per ha\nto introduce clean air to city centre\nto enable the outflow of congregated PM within the city due to vehicles and household heating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Types of PM Mitigation Urban Forest Types (Source: Korea Forest Service)\n\nApplication\n\nRemote sensing can come into play a key role in identifying what PM mitigation urban forest types are most suitable to a particular site within a city, and quantifying the amounts of PM absorbed by urban forests.\nRemote sensing is an effective measure to map and monitor PM concentrations (Zhang et al. 2021). This indicates that areas with routinely high PM concentrations can be detected by satellite images. Thus, government officials could take data-informed decisions and select the most suitable PM mitigation urban forest types for each particular area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage PM2.5 concentration between 2001 and 2006 mapped by remote sensing (Source: Zhang et al.)\nIn addition, Gupta et al. (2006) found that remote sensing can capture the movement of air pollutants over a large area as satellite measurements are available globally. Their findings allude to us that remote sensing could enable us to understand how much PM have been absorbed by urban forests by measuring the size of PM mass between areas. The policymakers could draw on these quantified data as a basis for future policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation of 1-year change of PM2.5 mass concentration in five study regions (Source: Gupta et al.)\n\nLink to UN SDG Goals\n\nAccording to United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the use of remote sensing could contribute to achieving 2 SDGs goals.\n\nSDG 3. Good Health and Well-Being\n\nPM causes various health problems, such as lung and heart diseases. The reduction in PM could improve citizen’s health and quality of life.\n\nSDG 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities\n\nCreating urban forests, as a measure to mitigate PM, could not only reduce aereal PM but also contribute to building a safe and resilient built environment from other natural hazards.\n\n\n\nReflection\n\nThis week’s contents were somewhat different from what we have learnt past few months. Understanding policy and how remote sensing could come into play its part in realising the policy’s objective was interesting. The contemplation upon how remote sensing can be applied at a particular context and a site broadened my understanding. Of course, I am aware that remote sensing is one of many solutions that could assist in achieving policy’s goals, and 1-size-fits-all approach is not sufficient to solve similar problems in different contexts. Thanks to this week’s lecture, however, I could say that I came to understand how we can apply our theoretical and technical knowledge about remote sensing to solve the real problems.\n\nReferences\n\nKorea Forest Service.
