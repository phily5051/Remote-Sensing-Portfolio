<h1>3 Remote Sensing Data</h1>

<h2>3.1 Summary</h2>

<h3>Causes of Remote Sensing Data Distortion</h3>

Remotely sensed images often require corrections to be available for analysis. The image distortions occur due to the following factors:

- View angle: depending on the angle of the sensor, the area of interest might look different.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/view_angle.jpeg')
```

- Topography: the shape of terrain might cause some flaws in the image.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/topography.png')
```

- Earth rotation: Earth's spinning motion poses another difficulty. Straight lines of an image can appear to be unnaturally curved or deformed.

knitr::include_graphics('img/rotation.gif')
```

- Wind, and so on.

<h3>Data Corrections</h3>

4 types of data correction methods are available for distorted images. These are Geometric, Atmospheric, Orthorectification, and Radiometric corrections! 

First, we can kick off with Geometric Correction!

<h4>*Geometric Correction*</h4>

*Geometric error*s are normally introduced by internal and external factors (attitude and altitude change). And Ground Control Points (GPS) can be used for correcting the errors! This means, basically, we are identifying so-called "known points" in both sensed image and a reference data and use them to build regression models! But we need each GCP, which are "image coordinate" and "map coordinate".

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/geomet.png')
```

*Linear Regression* in a "Backward mapping" fashion can be an answer to this problem. Backward mapping is going from output image to input image. This method goes through one pixel at a time and for each position in output image to calculate where in the input image a pixel must come from.

The result can be verified by using RMSE. The lower the value is, the more accurate the result is, and the threshold RMSE value is 0.5. To reduce the RMSE, more GPS can be added as well.But when we do this, we have to re-sample the final raster data. There are several resample methods, such as Nearest Neighbour, Linear, Cubic and Cubic spline.

<h4>*Atmospheric Correction*</h4>

Atmospheric correction removes scattering and absorption effects of the atmosphere to improve the image.
