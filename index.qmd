**Bio**: 

Hello, I am Phil from South Korea. 

I am studying a master's degree in Urban Spatial Science at UCL Bartlett CASA.

## Research Interest

My background is in forest science. I could say I have been interested in nature for a long time. In particular, I am a huge fan of urban green spaces. The fact that urban green spaces are within proximity to our daily life sphere and urban biodiversity depends on them fascinates me.

That is why I am studying at CASA to better understand the built environment with the hope to model a sustainable green city.  

I would love to learn more about how to model green spaces and best distribute the limited areas of them within a city. I hope I could understand how to maximise what urban green spaces can offer us and improve inhabitants' access to green spaces in their daily life.
