<h2>1.1 Summary</h2>

<h3>1.1.1 Definition of Remote Sensing</h3>

According to [NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/remote-sensing#:~:text=Remote%20sensing%20is%20the%20acquiring,record%20reflected%20or%20emitted%20energy.) (n.d.), remote sensing refers to **information obtained at a distance**. These sensors are placed on satellites or aircrafts and they detect and document reflected or emitted energy.

<h3>1.1.2 What kinds of energy?</h3>

TO cut it short, the answer is **Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)**. This energy travels in different forms of waves through the atmosphere. While human eyes only detects visible light, the sensors can utilise the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum to collect data.

<h3>1.1.3 Sensor Types</h3>

There are two types of remote sensors: active and passive sensors.

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Sensor Type    | Description                                                                                                                      |
+================+==================================================================================================================================+
| Active sensor  | -   emits electromagnetic energy and receives the reflected energy                                                               |
|                | -   can observe areas under most conditions as most active sensors operate in the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum |
|                | -   requires power source energy - solar energy                                                                                  |
|                | -   affected by space weather - solar flares                                                                                     |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Passive sensor | -   usually detects reflected energy                                                                                             |
|                | -   used for measuring physical attributes, such as land/sea surface temperature and vegetation cover                            |
|                | -   has limitations in observing areas in the presence of dense cloud cover                                                      |

```

<h3>1.1.4. Does EMR interact with other factors?</h3>

Yes, these radiations are often influenced by Earth's surface and atmospheric conditions, which might distort the original information.

```

<h3>1.1.5 4 Resolutions of Remote Sensing Data</h3>

-   **Spatial**:

    -   Sizes of the raster cells
    -   The smaller the measure is, the more detailed the image is

-   **Spectral**:

    -   Values for each wavelength across the electromagnetic spectrum creates a spectral signature
    -   Every object has its own unique spectral signature, thus it can be used for identifying a specific object
    -   But spectral resolution is often affected by atmospheric particles which absorb parts of the spectrum

knitr::include_graphics('img/Atmospheric-Electromagnetic-Opacity.png')
```

-   **Temporal**:

    -   frequency of the recorded data

-   **Radiometric**:

    -   Sensor's ability to detect subtle differences in energy which determines the quality of images

<h2>Application</h2>

In the context of climate change, the ability to map tree types are important as they are closely linked to biodiversity. As mentioned earlier, each feature has different spectral signatures.

In this section, we will have a look at two studies in which spectral signature are employed

**Identification of Trees**

@durgante2013 have discovered that

*spectral signature of tree species was better than DNA identification in distinguishing tree species.*

The researchers used 'Fourier-Transform Near-Infrared (FT-NIR)'. It obtained the best results of 99.4% of correct specimen identification when using 36 spectral readings per specimen. This somehow opens a new, cost- and time-efficient avenue in mapping forest resources. Their research is meaningful in a sense that it enables us to identify types of forests in which forests are not easily accessible by humans or should be intact from human interference.

```

**Blueberry Yield**

The potential of spectral signature can also be found in the business sector. @yang2012 suggested that spectral signatures could be employed to blueberry yield estimation system. The research team confirmed six-class blueberry classification - 233, 551, 554, 691, 699, 1373 nm - yielded the best results. This showed the potential of the spectral signature in developing fast and low cost blueberry detector. Furthermore, this research expands the use of spectral signatures from academia to industry, and suggests that the use of spectral signature can be boundless.

```

*A bit of Thought.....*

I was mind-blown when I found out that spectral signature is like DNA!! Initially, the remote sensing imagery is just an image taken from a far distance but it turned out that they contain a whole lot of information than they look. This fact sparked my curiosity. If each object has its own distinctive spectral signature, could we also use this for mining valuable resources buried somewhere on this planet that might save millions of life?!

Furthermore, with spectral signature, could we develop a ML model that helps us detect vulnerable or endangered species in the nature? This could be more time-, cost-effective than previous methods that are being employed in the field.

<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>

Before taking this lecture, I did hear about the terminology "remote sensing". But I have to admit that I was quite scared of it as it appealed to me so-called "Elite-science" because of NASA. Of course, we do see a lot of remote sensing imagery in our daily life but not many of us actually use the imagery to do work or study. In this regard, the introduction to remote sensing helped me feel more familiar with this domain of study field.

*Things I found interesting!!*

-   I, personally, found the spectral resolution very interesting. Its limitless usage - both in academia and business - made me wonder if it could be also used in the context of the **urban environment**. As a person who is interested in urban green spaces, I wondered whether the health of green spaces in a city can also be measured with the spectral resolution. For instance, ill trees could show different patterns compared to those of the healthy ones.
-   Furthermore, I was wondering whether there are any methods that **improve the quality of data obtained from passive sensors** as they cannot obtain a good quality data in the presence of bad weather. Under the circumstances where we have passive sensors, are there any techniques that could correct images?

*Any Considerations?*

While free access and publicly availability are the Earth Observation (EO) data' real power, the EO data should be treated with caution. The analysis based on EO data can be misleading if it does not contain any context data, such as demographic and economic data. Therefore, it seems necessary that we fully understand the context when we do our analysis!!

*Any link to policy?*

Apart from what I mentioned, there will be more opportunities that remote sensors can come into play in achieving policy goals. The terminology "remote sensing" is not yet appearing in policy documents, but the time will come. Who would not want to make use of freely available data and its numerous advantages??
